# bnf-parser
Parse Backus-Naur form syntaxs into parsers to generate ASTs of arbitrary syntaxs.

## TODOs
- Add explicit types to transforms by creating an object that defines the transform, and how to create explicit type signatures from a generic one
- Add a validity check to a language that checks that there are no unused rules
- stop doing module level parsing, and instead use factories
